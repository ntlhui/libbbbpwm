## Overview
libbbbpwm is a lightweight library intended to encapsulate the sysfs operations needed to use PWM on the BeagleBone Black running a 3.8 Linux kernel.  libbbbpwm simply automates and wraps the fileops that need to occur to bring up the proper PWM interfaces.  libbbbpwm was designed on the 3.8.13-bone50 kernel.
